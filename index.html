	<h2>Passion</h2>
	<p>I have an obsession with getting my nails done. I love to get acrylic nails. I've tried various colors with different designs. </p>

	<p>These nails are done by Pinky Nailxpert in Norfolk, Virginia.</p>
    <img src="nails3.jpg" width="280px">
    <img src="nails8.jpg" width="320px">
    <p>These nails are done by Lee Nails (Military Crossing Shopping Center) in Norfolk. </p>
    <img src="nails7.jpg" width="700px"> <p>The first four pictures were done at ABC Nail (Bromley Shopping Center) in Norfolk. The last five were done at Diamond Nail Spa in Norfolk.</p>
	<h2>Nail Ideas</h2>
	<p>I've recently switched to getting only gel polish because gel lasts longer, doesn't chip, and can't come off by nail polish remover. Typically gel cost $15 dollars extra when getting a full set and $12 when getting a fill in.These are nail designs from all over, not just Virginia.</p>
